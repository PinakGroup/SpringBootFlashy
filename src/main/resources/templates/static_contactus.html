												<br /> <br /> Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing
												from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike
												printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and
												updated, with articles on historic events appearing within
												minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can
												help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive
												than any other encyclopedia. In addition to quantity, its
												contributors work on improving quality as well. Wikipedia is
												a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of
												completion. As articles develop, they tend to become more
												comprehensive and balanced. Quality also improves over time
												as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired.
												However, because anyone can click "edit" at any time and add
												content, any article may contain undetected misinformation,
												errors, or vandalism. Awareness of this helps the reader to
												obtain valid information, avoid recently added
												misinformation (see Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia),
												and fix the article. <br />
